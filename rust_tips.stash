#### Lookup by Path

Find a type by entering either it's full path or just the "::":

<*>"<c><go "rust?std::vec::vec>std::vec::vec<><>"
"<c><go "rust?::vec>::vec<><>"<>


#### Lookup Symbols

Need to know what a symbol does? Just enter "symbol" and then the symbol you what:

<*>"<c><go "rust?symbol ::\<>symbol ::\<><><>"<><>


#### Use ESC to Reset

When youâ€™re done searching, hit Escape to clear your search and bring everything back into view.
